            "How do you add an event listener to an element in JavaScript?",
        answer: "To add an event listener to an element in JavaScript, you need to use the addEventListener method, specify the event type (such as click), and provide a function to be called when the event occurs.

        question:
            "What is the difference between the '==' and '===' operators?",
        answer: "The '==' (loose equality) operator compares values with type coercion. This means that before comparison, the '==' operator tries to convert the values to a common type. The '===' (strict equality) operator compares values without type coercion. This means that it compares values for both identity and type. In general, it's recommended to use the '===' operator to avoid unexpected type coercion results. However, in some cases, where it's known that the types of the compared values match, the '==' operator can be used.",
